Remote Jupyter Kernels via SSH
******************************

Launch and connect securely to Jupyter kernels on remote machines via SSH with minimal
configuration, as if they were local.

Quick Start
***********

Get up and running with sshpyk in minutes:

1. Install sshpyk on your local machine

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install sshpyk

See `Installation`_ for more details.

2. Add a **dedicated** alias configuration entry in your SSH ``config`` file (typically ``~/.ssh/config``):

.. code-block:: bash

  # You can name the alias anything you want, but we recommend to include "sshpyk"
  # in the name to remind yourself that this is a dedicated alias for sshpyk.
  Host sshpyk_remote_server
    HostName 192.168.1.100 # EDIT THIS
    User my_user_name_on_remote_server # EDIT THIS
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/private_key_for_remote_server # EDIT THIS
    StrictHostKeyChecking no
    ServerAliveInterval 10
    ServerAliveCountMax 60000
    TCPKeepAlive yes
    ControlMaster yes
    ControlPath ~/.ssh/sshpyk_%r@%h_%p
    ControlPersist 1m

See `Recommended SSH Config Setup`_ for more details.

3. Ensure you have SSH access to your remote server and public key authentication is set up, you must connect without password prompt:

.. code-block:: bash

  ssh sshpyk_remote_server

See `Authentication Requirements`_ for setting up SSH keys.

4. Add a remote kernel (replace values with your configuration):

.. code-block:: bash

  sshpyk add --ssh-host-alias sshpyk_remote_server \
              --kernel-name ssh_remote_python3 \
              --display-name "Remote Python 3.10" \
              --remote-python-prefix /path/to/python/env \
              --remote-kernel-name python3 \
              --language python

See `Adding a Remote Kernel`_ for all available options.

5. Start JupyterLab and select your new remote kernel for a notebook/console:

.. code-block:: bash

  jupyter lab

6. Your code now runs on the remote server and your local notebook interfaces with it!

7. (Optional) It might be useful to mount a local directory on the remote system (replace values with your configuration):

.. code-block:: bash

    sshpyk edit --kernel-name ssh_remote_python3 \
                --remote-sshfs /usr/bin/sshfs \
                --ssh-host-alias-local-on-remote local_on_remote_ssh_host_alias \
                --mount-local-on-remote "/local/project:/remote/mount"

See `Advanced: Using SSHFS Mounting`_ for details on mounting local directories on the
remote system.

Installation
************

You can install sshpyk using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install sshpyk

For development installation:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install -e ".[dev]"

Requirements:

* On the local system: ``sshpyk`` and ``jupyter_client``
* On the remote system: ``jupyter_client`` (which provides ``jupyter-kernel`` command)

Managing SSH Jupyter Kernels
****************************

``sshpyk`` provides a command-line interface to manage remote Jupyter kernels via SSH tunnels:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ sshpyk --help
  usage: sshpyk [-h] [--verbose] {list,add,edit,delete} ...

  Manage SSH Jupyter kernels (version 0.0)

  positional arguments:
    {list,add,edit,delete}

Adding a Remote Kernel
======================

To add a new remote kernel, use the ``add`` command. For a remote kernel to work:

* ``sshpyk`` must be installed on the local system (which depends on ``jupyter_client`` explicitly)
* ``jupyter_client`` must be installed on the remote system (which provides ``jupyter-kernel`` command)

Here's the help information for the ``add`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ sshpyk add --help

Editing an Existing Kernel
==========================

You can modify an existing kernel using the ``edit`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ sshpyk edit --help

Deleting a Kernel
=================

To remove a kernel, use the ``delete`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ sshpyk delete --help

SSH Configuration
*****************

Understanding SSH Host Aliases
==============================

The ``--ssh-host-alias`` parameter refers to host aliases defined in your SSH ``config`` file, **not** IP addresses.
These aliases, among other advantages, provide a convenient way to group connection
settings under a ``Host alias_name`` entry.
This simplifies making an SSH connection to just ``$ ssh alias_name`` and have the
SSH client use the settings defined under its ``Host alias_name`` entry.
For simplicity and maximum flexibility, ``sshpyk`` does not manage any of the SSH ``config`` options.
Instead we have a `Recommended SSH Config Setup`_ below.

ℹ️ Note
  Currently, Windows is not supported as neither local nor remote machine.

Recommended SSH Config Setup
============================

Your SSH configuration is typically stored in ``$HOME/.ssh/config``.
We highly recommend a **dedicated** alias entry that looks like this:

.. code-block:: bash

  # You can name the alias anything you want, but we recommend to include "sshpyk"
  # in the name to remind yourself that this is a dedicated alias for sshpyk.
  Host sshpyk_remote_server
    # Required config: HostName/User/IdentityFile
    # ##################################################################################
    # IP address of the remote system
    HostName 192.168.1.100 # EDIT THIS
    # Your unix username on the remote system
    User my_user_name_on_remote_server # EDIT THIS
    # Required for automated login, see `Authentication Requirements` for more details
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/private_key_for_remote_server # EDIT THIS
    # ##################################################################################

    # Connection stability: ServerAliveInterval/ServerAliveCountMax/TCPKeepAlive
    # ##################################################################################
    # Send a "heartbeat" to the server every ServerAliveInterval seconds, if no reply,
    # wait ServerAliveCountMax attempts before giving up.
    ServerAliveInterval 10
    # Set some big value, e.g. ServerAliveInterval * ServerAliveCountMax = ~7 days
    ServerAliveCountMax 60000
    TCPKeepAlive yes
    # ##################################################################################

    # Performance and responsiveness: ControlMaster/ControlPath/ControlPersist
    # ##################################################################################
    # Reuse existing connections to the remote server, this speeds up new connections
    # to the remote server by reusing a "master" connection.
    ControlMaster yes # DO NOT USE `auto` here, it does not work well with sshpyk.
    # The path to the control socket, this is used to manage the connection to the
    # remote server. Keep them in a *dedicated* directory to avoid conflicts with other
    # SSH connections and session to the same machine. Sharing the same control socket
    # other non-sshpyk related SSH sessions might have unintended side effects.
    # Make sure the dirs on the path to the control socket exist, otherwise strange
    # unrelated errors will popup!
    ControlPath ~/.ssh/sshpyk_%r@%h_%p
    # Keep the master connection "warm" for 1 minute after the last time the SSH
    # connection was used. For connection stability and to speed up kernel restarts.
    # Note that there will be some SSH process on your local machine still running for
    # ~1 minute after the kernel shutdown. This is expected and harmless.
    ControlPersist 1m
    # ##################################################################################

    # The port on the remote system that SSH server is listening on (22 is the default)
    Port 22
    # Optional, slightly less secure but recommended for this type of automation:
    StrictHostKeyChecking no

    # ... rest of your config, if you know what you are doing

With this configuration, you can use ``sshpyk_remote_server`` as your ``--ssh-host-alias`` in ``sshpyk`` commands.

⚠️ Warning
  Make sure that your alias name in the SSH ``config`` does not match any other alias
  "wildcards" in your SSH ``config`` unintentionally. For example, if you have an alias
  ``*_remote_server`` in your SSH ``config``, these settings can affect
  the ``sshpyk_remote_server`` as well, which might lead to unexpected behavior.

‼️ Important
  We highly recommend using the suggested ``ServerAliveInterval``,
  ``ServerAliveCountMax``, ``TCPKeepAlive``, ``ControlMaster``, ``ControlPath``,
  and ``ControlPersist`` settings.
  This is to ensure that your SSH connection is stable and does not get dropped
  unexpectedly. With these settings your connection to the remote kernel should
  survive, e.g., losing your WiFi connection for a few minutes, and perhaps even
  longer.

Authentication Requirements
===========================

‼️ Important
  ``sshpyk`` only supports key-based SSH authentication. You must set up SSH key authentication
  for all remote hosts you intend to use.

To set up SSH key-based authentication:

1. Generate an SSH key pair on your local machine (if you don't already have one):

.. code-block:: bash

  ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/private_key_for_remote_server -C "some comment for your own reference"

2. Copy your public key to the remote server:

.. code-block:: bash

  ssh-copy-id remote_username@some.remote.server.com

Or manually add the contents of ``~/.ssh/private_key_for_remote_server.pub`` from your local machine to ``~/.ssh/authorized_keys`` on the remote machine.

3. Add the key to your SSH config (edit to match your own setup):

.. code-block:: bash

  Host sshpyk_remote_server
    HostName some.remote.server.com
    User remote_username
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/private_key_for_remote_server
    # ... the rest of the config as described in `Recommended SSH Config Setup`

4. Test your connection, you should connect without being prompted for a password:

.. code-block:: bash

  ssh sshpyk_remote_server

Advanced: Using Bastion/Jump Hosts
==================================

One powerful SSH feature is the ability to connect to hosts behind a bastion (jump) server.
For example in your SSH config you would add the following **dedicated** alias entries:

.. code-block:: bash

  Host sshpyk_bastion
    HostName bastion.example.com
    User bastion-username
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_bastion # required for automated login
    # ... the rest of the config as described in `Recommended SSH Config Setup`

  Host sshpyk_internal_server
    HostName internal-server.example.com
    User remote-username
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_internal # required for automated login

    ProxyJump sshpyk_bastion # this is the key line that enables the "jump" through the bastion
    # ... the rest of the config as described in `Recommended SSH Config Setup`

‼️ Important
  For connection stability and performance, we highly recommend using the settings
  described in `Recommended SSH Config Setup` along with using dedicated alias entries.

This configuration allows you to:

1. Connect first to ``bastion.example.com`` as ``bastion-username``
2. Then tunnel through to ``internal-server.example.com`` as ``remote-username``

When using sshpyk, you would simply specify ``--ssh-host-alias sshpyk_internal_server``
and the SSH tunneling will be handled automatically according to your SSH ``config`` file.

‼️ Important
  Remember that SSH key-based authentication must be set up for both the
  local_machine ``sshpyk_bastion`` host and the ``sshpyk_internal_server``.

💡 Tip
  You can of course have as many bastion hosts between you and the remote server as you want.

Advanced: Using SSHFS Mounting
==============================

``sshpyk`` supports mounting local directories on the remote system using SSHFS,
which allows seamless file sharing between your local and remote environments. For this
to work, your user on the remote system must be authorized to ssh into your local machine
using SSH key authentication.
``sshpyk`` will setup reverse tunnels and run ``sshfs`` command on the remote system
to mount the local directories. For security reasons, ``sshpyk`` will only allow SFTP
access to the mounted directories.

Requirements
------------

To use SSHFS mounting:

1. SSHFS must be installed on the remote system. This is a user space program so you should be able to install it without admin privileges.
2. SSH daemon command (``sshd``) must be available on the local system. Usually it is available if you already have SSH available.
3. The remote system must have an SSH config entry that points back to your local machine.


Configuration
-------------

When adding or editing a kernel with SSHFS support, you need to specify:

* ``--remote-sshfs`` - Path to the sshfs executable on the remote system
* ``--ssh-host-alias-local-on-remote`` - SSH host alias on the remote system that points to your local machine
* ``--mount-local-on-remote`` - Directory pairs to mount, in format: ``/local/path:/remote/path[:sshfs_options]``

Example Setup
-------------

1. On the remote system, add an entry to ``~/.ssh/config`` that points back to your local machine

.. code-block:: text

  Host local_machine_on_remote
    # Keep this to `localhost`
    HostName localhost
    # Edit this to match your local username
    User your_local_username
    # Edit this to match a private key on the remote system
    # that is authorized on your local machine
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_authorized_to_ssh_into_your_local_machine
    StrictHostKeyChecking no

2. Add a kernel with SSHFS support (or edit and existing one)

.. code-block:: bash

  sshpyk add --ssh-host-alias remote_server \
        --kernel-name ssh_remote_python \
        --display-name "Remote Python with SSHFS" \
        --language python \
        --remote-python-prefix /path/to/python \
        --remote-kernel-name python3 \
        --remote-sshfs /usr/bin/sshfs \
        --ssh-host-alias-local-on-remote local_machine_on_remote \
        --mount-local-on-remote "/local/project:/remote/mount"

3. Or add SSHFS to an existing kernel

.. code-block:: bash

  sshpyk edit --kernel-name ssh_remote_python \
              --remote-sshfs /usr/bin/sshfs \
              --ssh-host-alias-local-on-remote local_machine_on_remote \
              --mount-local-on-remote "/local/project:/remote/mount"

Advanced SSHFS Options
----------------------

You can specify multiple mount points and custom SSHFS options:

.. code-block:: bash

  sshpyk add ... \
      --mount-local-on-remote "/local/code:/remote/code:allow_other,follow_symlinks" \
      --mount-local-on-remote "/local/data:/remote/data"

Common SSHFS options include:

* ``allow_other`` - Allow other users to access the mounted filesystem
* ``follow_symlinks`` - Follow symbolic links on the local filesystem
* ``compression=yes`` - Enable compression for better performance

See ``sshfs --help`` for more options.

Development
***********

In a Python 3.8+ environment:

1. ``pip install -e ".[dev]"`` # installs the python package in editable mode
2. Reload your shell, e.g. open the terminal again.
3. ``pre-commit install``
4. Make your changes to the files and test them.
5. ``git commit -m "your message"``, this will run the pre-commit hooks defined in ``.pre-commit-config.yaml``. If your code has problems it won't let you commit.

Run git hooks manually
======================

To auto-format code, apply other small fixes (e.g. trailing whitespace) and to lint all the code:

.. code-block:: bash

  pre-commit run --all-files

Troubleshooting
===============

If you are running into issues, try first to restart your system 😉.

To debug problems during kernel launch/shutdown/restart/etc, you can run a command similar to the following to see verbose logs:

.. code-block:: bash

  # `grep SSHPYK` will filter the output to only show sshpyk logs
  # We use `script` to save the output to a file and `jupyter lab --no-browser --debug`
  # to run jupyter lab in debug mode. `script` allows to pass input to the jupyter lab
  script -q jupyter_sshpyk.log jupyter lab --no-browser --debug | grep SSHPYK

This will save the output to a file and show it in real time.
You can share the log file with us if you are running into issues.

Implementation Details
======================

sshpyk integrates with Jupyter Client through the kernel provisioning API introduced in ``jupyter_client`` 7.0+.
It implements a custom ``KernelProvisionerBase`` subclass called ``SSHKernelProvisioner`` that:

1. Establishes SSH connections to remote hosts
2. Sets up port forwarding for kernel communication channels
3. Launches kernels on remote systems
4. Manages the lifecycle of remote kernels

The provisioner is registered as an entry point in ``pyproject.toml``, making it available to any
Jupyter application that uses ``jupyter_client``.

Historical Note
===============

The design of this package was initially inspired upon `SSH Kernel <https://github.com/bernhard-42/ssh_ipykernel>`_ which
in turn is based upon `remote_ikernel <https://bitbucket.org/tdaff/remote_ikernel>`_. This implementation was
created to adapt to recent changes to ``jupyter_client`` (which broke ``ssh_ipykernel``)
and to support Python 3.10+. Later it was reimplemented to integrate with ``jupyter_client``'s provisioning system.
